consider a model has two features one with significantly larger magnitudes than the other. thus to utilize the feature and not have it significantly affect tthe final value, or in the other terms using a multitude of features and having them all affect the final value we use  feature scaling also called z score normalization:
	z=(x-u)/std deviation
