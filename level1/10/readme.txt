visualise gradient descent;
 this problem is used to analyse the rise in the directionof motion of x as the values of x increase the consequent values of f(x) are effected in what way
10. Visualize Gradient Descent
    • Task: Plot loss function and gradient descent path.
    • Dataset: f(x)=x2.
    • Hints: Store intermediate points at each step.
    • Expected outcome: Points move toward minimum at x=0.
